        <h2> My Projects</h2>
        <p> So far, I have 2 big projects. The first <br> includes a project a friend and I created for <br> our employer, Sonic. <br>
          <br> The second big project that I have is this one. <br> The difference between the Sonic website and this <br> one is that this is all about me. Enjoy!
          <br>
          <br> I will have more projects coming soon!</p>

          <a href="https://nikeologist.github.io/Hedgehogs/"> <strong> Here is the website I created for Sonic.</strong></a> <br>
          <p> I created this project for my Coding 1 class at school. This website was challenging because I had never made a website before and I was struggling with where to start.<br> <br>
              It was hard to gather the information needed and coding it was even harder. Overall, I had a great experience making this website, and I hope you enjoy!</p>

          <p> I have also created this project for my Coding 1 class. This time around, my experience putting together this information is much different. I do not feel as stressed and it has became easier to make<br>
              the more I progress on this website. <br> <br> Furthermore, the enjoyment I have gained from making my digital portfolio has been very fun, and I hope you like my website!</p>
